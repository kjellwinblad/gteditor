I'm very happy if you have suggestions, bug reports or other feedback for the program. The best way is then to report them on the project home page:

http://code.google.com/p/gteditor/

Click on the tab called issues and then click on new issue

If you want to contact the main developer personally then use the e-mail: kjellwinblad@gmail.com

I got a lot of help and suggestion from my supervisor [Klas Markstr√∂m](http://abel.math.umu.se/%7Eklasm/). The program was done as a bachelor thesis project and Klas suggested the project from the beginning. To see the project report and a the project diary from the time when the program was in heavy development please see this project page http://www.cs.umu.se/~kjellw/exjobb/ (Swedish!).
